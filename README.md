# Bayesian-estimation-of-the-GJR-1-1-model-with-student-t-innovations-and-explanatory-variables
The GJR time series model is a proficient model for time series analysis. Furthermore, Bayesian estimations of these model is essential for small data sets analysis. Here, we provide a R code for estimating the GJR(1,1) model with explanatory variables.
